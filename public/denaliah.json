If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.</p>\r\n<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>\r\n<p>The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ivory Goats.</strong> These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <em>goat of traveling</em> can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.</li>\r\n<li>The <em>goat of travail</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.</li>\r\n<li>The <em>goat of terror</em> becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a <strong>lance, +1</strong>, and the other becomes a <strong>longsword, +2</strong>. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.<br><br></li>\r\n</ul>",

              "description": "<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See <span style=\"color:#9c0\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#936\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&filter-search=&filter-sub-class=&filter-concentration=&filter-ritual=&filter-unlocked-content=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5>Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5>Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span>magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don&rsquo;t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p>You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&rsquo;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The Book&rsquo;s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

              "description": "<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See <span style=\"color:#9c0\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#936\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&filter-search=&filter-sub-class=&filter-concentration=&filter-ritual=&filter-unlocked-content=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spells Listing</a></span>&nbsp;for the wizard&nbsp;spell list.</p>\r\n<h5>Cantrips</h5>\r\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5>Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span>magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don&rsquo;t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p>You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&rsquo;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The Book&rsquo;s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span>magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don&rsquo;t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p>You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&rsquo;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The Book&rsquo;s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p>\r\n<p><strong>On Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Off Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 &times; 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mishap.</strong> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.</p>\r\n<p>Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\r\n<p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.</p>\r\n<p>While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>\r\n<p>As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p>\r\n<p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</p>",

If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p>\r\n<p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature--what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p>\r\n<p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p>\r\n<p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.</p>\r\n<p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</p>",

You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>\r\n<p>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (<a class=\"tooltip-hover\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\" data-tooltip-href=\"http:www.dndbeyond.com/skills/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&disable-webm=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Investigation</a>) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p>\r\n<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>\r\n<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don&rsquo;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\r\n<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose&nbsp;<em><span>explosive runes</span></em>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<span><em>spell glyph</em>.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><strong><span>Explosive Runes.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><span>Spell Glyph.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>At Higher Levels.</span></strong>&nbsp;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an&nbsp;<span><em>explosive runes</em>&nbsp;</span>glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a&nbsp;<em><span>spell glyph</span></em>, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the&nbsp;<em><span>glyp</span></em><span><em>h of warding</em>.</span></p>",

Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</p>\r\n<p>Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence--a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.</p>\r\n<p>You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year.

Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves&rsquo; guilds and street gangs. You might be a &ldquo;velvet mask&rdquo; bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists.

You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\r\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn&rsquo;t stand on its own&mdash;it&rsquo;s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\r\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title?

An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p>\r\n<p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;History, Persuasion</dt>\r\n<dt><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set</dt>\r\n<dt><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</dt>\r\n<dt><strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp</dt>\r\n</dl>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>FEATURE: POSITION OF PRIVILEGE</strong></p>\r\n<p>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere.

If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span>you put it on).</span></p>\r\n<p>As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart &mdash; in a chaste sort of devotion.

These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5>\r\n<p>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing.

        "shortDescription": "<p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\r\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn&rsquo;t stand on its own&mdash;it&rsquo;s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\r\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don&rsquo;t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family&rsquo;s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\r\n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p>\r\n<p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Many organizations active in the North and across the face of Faer&ucirc;n aren&rsquo;t bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction&rsquo;s operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few.

If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some poss<span>ibilities.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span><span>Harpers:&nbsp;</span></strong>Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harper<span>s&rsquo; ideals.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span></strong><span><strong>Order of the Gauntlet:</strong>&nbsp;</span>One of the newest power groups in Faer&ucirc;n, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order&rsquo;s ideals, and the clergy of the order&rsquo;s pa<span>tron gods.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span></strong><span><strong>Emerald Enclave:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods <span>of nature.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span></strong><span><strong>Lords&rsquo; Alliance:</strong>&nbsp;</span>On one level, the agents of the Lords&rsquo; Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance<span>&rsquo;s ideals.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span></strong><span><strong>Zhentarim:</strong>&nbsp;</span>In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren&rsquo;t necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the <span>Zhentarim.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true i<span>dentities.</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5>\r\n<p>Use the tables for the acolyte background below&nbsp;as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent.

To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided.

The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this b<span>ackground.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Evermeet.</span></strong> The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faer&ucirc;n. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your<span> homeland.</span></p>\r\n<p>Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faer&ucirc;n for a purpose that benefits elven culture o<span>r society.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Halruaa.</span></strong> Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faer&ucirc;n who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can w<span>ork magic.</span></p>\r\n<p>Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faer&ucirc;n for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa&rsquo;s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods<span> of magic.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Kara-Tur.</span></strong> The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faer&ucirc;n, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faer&ucirc;n likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn&rsquo;t your true ethnicity, because that&rsquo;s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares yo<span>ur origin.</span></p>\r\n<p>The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faer&ucirc;n as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission<span> was over.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Mulhorand.</span></strong> From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faer&ucirc;n. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts <span>of Faer&ucirc;n.</span></p>\r\n<p>Those who leave behind Mulhorand&rsquo;s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of <span>your home.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Sossal.</span></strong> Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed<span> in white.</span></p>\r\n<p>Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly <span>important.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Zakhara.</span></strong> As the saying goes among those in Faer&ucirc;n who know of the place, &ldquo;To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.&rdquo; Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn&rsquo;t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faer&ucirc;n for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as<span> you have.</span></p>\r\n<p>You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your ow<span>n deities.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span><span>Underdark.</span></strong> Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place&mdash;but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you wer<span>e a child.</span></p>\r\n<p>If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren&rsquo;t a native, your reason for leaving &ldquo;home&rdquo; probably has something to do with getting away from a bad <span>situation.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h5>Feature: All Eyes on You</h5>\r\n<p>Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your<span> homeland.</span></p>\r\n<p>You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland a<span>nd people.<br></span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h5 class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;Suggested Characteristics&nbsp;</h5>\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d6</th>\r\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Personality Trait</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td>I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others&rsquo; space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td>I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don&rsquo;t comprehend.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n<td>I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td>I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>6</td>\r\n<td>Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d6</th>\r\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Ideal</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td><span>Open.</span> I have much to learn from the kindly folk I meet along my way.

        "description": "<p>You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faer&ucirc;n has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and respons<span>ibilities.</span></p>\r\n<p>Though the term &ldquo;knight&rdquo; conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faer&ucirc;n don&rsquo;t restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren&rsquo;t limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the orde<span>r&rsquo;s cause.</span></p>\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Knightly Orders of Faer&ucirc;n&rdquo; sidebar details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe alle<span>giance to.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span><strong>KNIGHTLY ORDERS OF&nbsp;<strong>FAER&Ucirc;N</strong></strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Many who rightfully call themselves &ldquo;knight&rdquo; earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor&rsquo;s Eternal Order or Mystra&rsquo;s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faer&ucirc;n who hear the word &ldquo;knight&rdquo; think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly orga<span>nizations.</span> <br><strong><span>Knights of the Unicorn.</span> </strong></span><span>The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur&rsquo;s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue&rsquo;s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their w<span>eaknesses.</span> <br><strong><span>Knights of Myth Drannor.</span></strong> Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil.

        "shortDescription": "<p>You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faer&ucirc;n has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and respons<span>ibilities.</span></p>\r\n<p>Though the term &ldquo;knight&rdquo; conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faer&ucirc;n don&rsquo;t restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren&rsquo;t limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the orde<span>r&rsquo;s cause.</span></p>\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Knightly Orders of Faer&ucirc;n&rdquo; sidebar details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe alle<span>giance to.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span><strong>KNIGHTLY ORDERS OF&nbsp;<strong>FAER&Ucirc;N</strong></strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Many who rightfully call themselves &ldquo;knight&rdquo; earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor&rsquo;s Eternal Order or Mystra&rsquo;s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faer&ucirc;n who hear the word &ldquo;knight&rdquo; think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly orga<span>nizations.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>Knights of the Unicorn.</span>&nbsp;</strong></span><span>The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur&rsquo;s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue&rsquo;s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their w<span>eaknesses.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>Knights of Myth Drannor.</span></strong>&nbsp;Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they&rsquo;ve begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant a<span>nd honest.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>Knights of the Silver Chalice.</span></strong>&nbsp;The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago.

Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit such as the Zhentarim or the soldiers of Mintarn, or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one. (See the &ldquo;Mercenaries of the North&rdquo; sidebar for a collection of possi<span>bilities.)</span></p>\r\n<p>Now you&rsquo;re looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you&rsquo;re leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a diff<span>erent way.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span><strong>MERCENARIES OF THE NORTH</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the North. Most are small-scale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are descri<span>bed below.</span> <br><strong><span>The Chill.</span></strong> The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few city-states in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civ<span>ilization.</span> <br><strong><span>Silent Rain.</span></strong> Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if i<span>nterested.</span> <br><strong><span>The Bloodaxes.</span></strong> Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold <span>Bloodaxes.</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p><strong><span>Skill Proficiencies:</span></strong>&nbsp;Athletics, <span>Persuasion<br></span><strong><span>Tool Proficiencies:</span></strong> One type of gaming set, vehic<span>les (land)<br></span><strong><span>Equipment:</span></strong> A uniform of your company (traveler&rsquo;s clothes in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming set of your choice, and a pouch containing the remainder of your last wag<span>es (10 gp)</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>FEATURE: MERCENARY LIFE</strong></p>\r\n<p>You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can.

        "shortDescription": "<p>As a sell-sword who fought battles for coin, you&rsquo;re well acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a share of treasure. Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit such as the Zhentarim or the soldiers of Mintarn, or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one. (See the &ldquo;Mercenaries of the North&rdquo; sidebar for a collection of possi<span>bilities.)</span></p>\r\n<p>Now you&rsquo;re looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you&rsquo;re leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a diff<span>erent way.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span><strong>MERCENARIES OF THE NORTH</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the North. Most are small-scale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are descri<span>bed below.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>The Chill.</span></strong>&nbsp;The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few city-states in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civ<span>ilization.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>Silent Rain.</span></strong>&nbsp;Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if i<span>nterested.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>The Bloodaxes.</span></strong>&nbsp;Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold&nbsp;<span>Bloodaxes.</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>",

Tradition and taboo have kept the Uthgardt strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin. But for the last few generations, some bands among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why Uthgar chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of Uthgar led bands back to the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civ<span>ilization.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong><span>BARBARIAN TRIBES OF&nbsp;<strong>FAER&Ucirc;N</strong></span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Though this section details the Uthgardt specifically, either it or the outlander background from the&nbsp;<span>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</span>&nbsp;can be used for a character whose origin lies with one of the other barbarian tribes&nbsp;<span>in Faer&ucirc;n.</span>&nbsp;You might be a fair-haired barbarian of the Reghed, dwelling in the shadow of the Reghed Glacier in the far North near Icewind Dale.
